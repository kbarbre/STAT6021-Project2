# STAT6021-Project2
The project completed here is for the UVA MSDS Fall 2020 STAT 6021 Final Project (Project 2). We are exploring the effects of beauty and other factors on professor's evaluation scores. The data is built into the R library AER called TeachingRatings.

- 'Project-2.Rmd' contains the R Markdown document. This is where main edits shows be made.
- 'Project-2.R' is automatically pulled from the R Markdown file when it is knitted.
- 'Project-2.pdf' is the PDF file made when the R Markdown file is knitted.
